# Hashnode Client

Hashnode client is a community-driven Open Source Project that provides APIs to interact with the `Headless Hashnode` from any `ReactJS` based applications. It means you can use the APIs from ReactJS, Next.js, Gatsby, and many more libraries and frameworks to build your blog front end.

The main goal of this project is to provide you with a public NPM package called `hashcode-client`, which will contain a bunch of useful APIs for interacting with the `Headless Hashnode`. Along with it, you can also play with the application called `Hashnode Diaries`, which uses the APIs from the `hashcode-client` NPM package.

## What is Headless Hashnode?
[Headless Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/headless) empowers you to build a blog from the ground up using Hashnode's innovative GraphQL APIs. It is a powerful headless CMS optimized for building and running blogs.

## Project Structure
This project has two primary objectives:
- Create an NPM package to connect and interact with the Headless Hashnode APIs.
- Use the NPM package in an application to demonstrate the possibilities.

Hence, you will find two primary project directories here:
- [package](./package/): Contains the source code to build and test the NPM package.
- [hashnode-diaries](./hashnode-diaries/): A Next.js application uses the NPM package where you can provide any Hashnode blog URL to fetch the posts from them.

## How do you run this project locally?
Please check the [package](./package/readme.md) and [hashnode-diaries](./hashnode-diaries/README.md) projects to learn how to run them locally.

## Why did we create it?
Developers should blog. At the same time, they need to customize and personaize their blog front end user interfaces. In that case, locking the blog with a specific vendor may not be a good idea. The `Headless Hashnode` is a great innovation where we get all our blog data through GraphQL APIs along with getting the opportunity to use the Hashnode infrastructure under the hood.

It means we can create a blog front end of our choice using GraphQL APIs. Considering most web developers today are ReactJS-focused (with all due respect to every other technology on the earth!), we have created this NPM package to make things easy for React developers. They can just use this package to import a few hooks(utilities) they need and get the job done!

Advantages are:
- No need to know GraphQL.
- Lesser code.
- Building it as an Open Source project to get it improved by the community.
- It is(and will be) FREE forever.
