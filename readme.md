# Hashnode Client

Hashnode client is a community-driven Open Source Project provides APIs to interact with the `Headless Hashnode` from any `ReactJS` based applications. It means, you can use the APIs from ReactJS, Next.js, Gatsby, and with many more libraries and frameworks to build your blog front-end.

The main goal of this project is to provide you with a public NPM package called `hashnode-client` which will contain a bunch of useful APIs for interacting with the `Headless Hashnode`. Along with it, you can also play with the an application called `Hashnode Diaries` which will use the APIs from the `hashnode-client` NPM package.
